This is a sample vignette that contains an error which will be detected
by HTML Tidy.

The error is the use of a non-existent tag, "foobar":

<foobar>

Run `example(getDataposConcordance)` to see before and after reports.

Still to do:  We need to get `knitr` to output concordance comments,
so that the intermediate Markdown file refers to this Rmd file.  For
now, we enter it by hand:

<!-- concordance::Sample.Rmd:1 9 1 1 6 14 1 -->
